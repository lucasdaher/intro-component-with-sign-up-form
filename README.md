## My process

I started the project doing all the indexing.html and then moving on to the style.css styling. After all the HTML and CSS was done, I went to JavaScript, where I did a check for the email using **match** and the checks so that if the input value of each form is empty it changes the **span** that contains the error message and changes the styling of the input to the error style.

### Built with

I get a lot of inspiration from a content creator called **ASMR Prog** ([YouTube ASMR Prog](https://www.youtube.com/@AsmrProg)). Some of his content, even if it is unexplained, ended up helping me at the beginning when I was learning and to this day it has been helping and influencing me a lot.
